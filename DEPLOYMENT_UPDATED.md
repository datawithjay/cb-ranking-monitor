# ðŸš€ Updated Deployment Strategy

## ðŸ’° **Cost Analysis**

| Solution | Dashboard | Hourly Scraping | Total Cost |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Vercel Only** | Free | $20/month | $20/month |
| **Hybrid (Recommended)** | Free | Free | **$0/month** |
| **GitHub Only** | $0 | Free | $0/month |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended: Hybrid Approach**

### **Why This is Best:**
- âœ… **$0/month total cost**
- âœ… **Best dashboard experience** (Vercel's Next.js hosting)
- âœ… **Reliable hourly scraping** (GitHub Actions)
- âœ… **Easy management** (both platforms you already have)

## ðŸ“‹ **Deployment Plan**

### **Step 1: Deploy Dashboard to Vercel (Free)**
- Host your Next.js dashboard
- Environment variables for Supabase
- Instant global deployment

### **Step 2: Setup GitHub Actions for Scraping (Free)**
- Automated hourly scraping
- Runs on GitHub's servers
- 2,000 minutes/month free (you'll use ~50 minutes)

### **Step 3: Configure Both Services**
- Add Supabase credentials to both platforms
- Test the complete workflow

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Deploy?**

**Let's start with the dashboard on Vercel, then setup GitHub Actions!**

The scraping will be completely independent from your dashboard hosting.
